# Tab-Based Content Switcher

This project is a simple tab-based content switcher built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to switch between different sections of content by clicking on tabs. Each tab displays unique content while hiding the others, and the background color changes dynamically based on the selected tab.

## Features
- Four tabs to switch between different content sections.
- Smooth content transition with only one section visible at a time.
- Dynamic background color change based on the selected tab.
- Simple and clean user interface with hover effects.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for content switching and background color updates.

## How It Works
1. The webpage initially displays a "Welcome" message.
2. Clicking on a tab hides the welcome message and shows the respective tab's content.
3. The background color of the page changes dynamically based on the selected tab.
4. Only one tab's content is visible at a time, ensuring a clean UI.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Click on any tab to view its content.
- Observe the background color change dynamically.

This project is great for beginners looking to learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling using JavaScript. ðŸš€
